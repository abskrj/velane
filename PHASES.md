# Runeforge — Build Phases

This document tracks the phased implementation plan for Runeforge. Each phase delivers a working, shippable increment. Phases build on each other — complete Phase N before starting Phase N+1.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Runtime (complete)

**Goal:** A fully runnable local stack that can execute code snippets synchronously.

### Delivered
- Go control plane HTTP API (chi router)
- Postgres schema with auto-applied migrations
- API key authentication (prefix lookup + bcrypt, `invoke` / `manage` / `admin` scopes)
- Snippet CRUD — create, list, get, delete
- Versioned deployments — each publish creates an immutable numbered version
- `dev` and `prod` environments per snippet
- Sync invocation: `POST /v1/invoke/{tenant}/{snippet}` → blocks until result
- ProcessExecutor — HTTP bridge to per-language executor containers (Bun, Python)
- Executor runtimes — Bun (`runner.ts`) and Python (`runner.py`) as persistent HTTP servers
- Tenant isolation enforced on every read and invocation
- Full test suite: 28 unit tests (zero deps) + integration tests (require `TEST_DATABASE_URL`)
- `docker-compose.yml` for local development

### Stack
- Control plane: Go 1.22, chi, pgx/v5, zap
- Runtimes: Bun 1.1, Python 3.12 + FastAPI
- Storage: Postgres 16
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose (local), Kubernetes + Terraform (production path)

---

## Phase 2 — Async, Streaming & Warm Pool

**Goal:** Support long-running and streaming snippets at scale; eliminate cold-start penalty for hot snippets.

### Scope
- **Async invocation** — `X-Invoke-Mode: async` returns `202 { invocation_id }` immediately; snippet runs in background
- **Async polling** — `GET /v1/invocations/{id}` already exists; Phase 2 adds webhook delivery on completion (`callback_url` in invoke body)
- **Streaming invocation** — `X-Invoke-Mode: stream` returns `text/event-stream`; snippet yields chunks via `yield` (Python) or async generator (Bun)
- **Redis job queue** — async jobs enqueued to Redis, worker pool dequeues and dispatches to executor
- **Warm pool manager** — K8s Deployment per language; tenant-configurable `min_instances` per snippet; slot claim/release via Redis atomic ops
- **Version pinning** — callers can specify `?version=v3` to invoke a pinned version instead of the active one

### New API surface
```
POST /v1/invoke/{tenant}/{snippet}
  X-Invoke-Mode: async    → 202 { invocation_id, status_url }
  X-Invoke-Mode: stream   → 200 text/event-stream
  Body: { ..., callback_url?: string }  (async only)
```

### New infrastructure
- Redis (added to docker-compose and Terraform)
- Worker service (Go) — pulls from Redis queue, dispatches to executor, updates invocation record, fires webhook
- `SnippetEnvironment.min_instances` — warm pool manager watches this and maintains ready slots

---

## Phase 3 — Staging, Canary & Secrets

**Goal:** Full three-environment promotion flow with safe traffic-splitting and secret injection.

### Scope
- **Staging environment** — third env (`dev` → `staging` → `prod`); `POST /v1/snippets/{id}/versions/{num}/publish?env=staging`
- **Canary traffic splitting** — `POST /v1/snippets/{id}/canary` sets `{ version_id, percent }` on the prod environment; Traffic Router sends X% to canary version, 100-X% to stable
- **Rollback** — re-publish any archived version to instantly swap active version
- **Secrets manager** — `POST /v1/secrets` to store encrypted key-value pairs; injected as env vars at invocation time; never returned in API responses
- **Egress policy engine** — per-tenant IP/CIDR blocklist enforced via iptables inside executor net namespace; default blocks `169.254.0.0/16`, RFC1918 ranges, and configurable domain sinkhole

### New API surface
```
POST   /v1/secrets                    → create secret (manage scope)
GET    /v1/secrets                    → list secret names (never values)
DELETE /v1/secrets/{id}              → delete secret

POST   /v1/snippets/{id}/canary       → set canary { version_id, percent }
DELETE /v1/snippets/{id}/canary       → remove canary (full traffic to active)

GET    /v1/tenants/{slug}/egress      → get egress policy
PUT    /v1/tenants/{slug}/egress      → update egress policy (admin scope)
```

### New data model
```sql
secrets (id, tenant_id, snippet_id nullable, name, value_encrypted, environments[])
snippet_environments.canary_version_id
snippet_environments.canary_pct
```

---

## Phase 4 — Developer Surfaces

**Goal:** Give engineers three ways to write and deploy snippets: Web IDE, CLI, and Git push-to-deploy.

### Scope
- **Web IDE** — Monaco editor in React; syntax highlighting for Bun/Python; inline error display; test-invoke panel; version history sidebar; publish button with env selector
- **CLI tool** (`runeforge` binary, distributed via npm and Homebrew)
  ```
  runeforge login               # authenticate, store key in system keychain
  runeforge snippets list
  runeforge snippets push <file>  # create/update draft, optionally publish
  runeforge invoke <slug> [--env prod] [--input '{}']
  runeforge logs <slug>
  ```
- **Git webhook integration** — connect a GitHub/GitLab repo; push to `main` → deploy to `staging`; push a tag (`v*`) → deploy to `prod`; PR branch → deploy to `dev` (preview env)

### New services
- `web-ide/` — Vite + React SPA, deployed to `app.runeforge.io`
- `cli/` — Go CLI (cobra), distributed as single binary
- Webhook receiver endpoint on control plane: `POST /v1/webhooks/git`

---

## Phase 5 — Observability

**Goal:** Give engineers full visibility into every invocation — logs, metrics, and replay.

### Scope
- **Structured logs** — stdout/stderr captured per invocation, stored in S3-compatible store (MinIO locally), queryable via API with filters (snippet, env, status, time range)
- **Metrics** — per-invocation row written to ClickHouse: `duration_ms`, `peak_memory_mb`, `cpu_ms`, `status`; aggregated into p50/p95/p99 per snippet
- **Metrics API** — `GET /v1/metrics/snippets/{id}?window=1h|24h|7d` returns time-series and aggregates
- **Log query API** — `GET /v1/logs/snippets/{id}?limit=50&status=failed`
- **Replay** — `POST /v1/invocations/{id}/replay` re-runs with the same input payload; requires `input_ref` stored in S3 (opt-in per tenant for privacy)
- **Multi-tenant namespace provider** — pluggable `TenantProvider` interface; ships `SharedTenantProvider` (default) and `NamespacedTenantProvider` (dedicated K8s namespace + NetworkPolicy + ResourceQuota per tenant)

### New infrastructure
- ClickHouse (added to docker-compose and Terraform)
- MinIO / S3 bucket (log and replay payload storage)
- `ObservabilityWorker` — async goroutine pool that ships log lines and metrics rows after each invocation

---

## Phase 6 — MCP Server (Cursor / Claude Code Integration)

**Goal:** Let engineers connect Cursor, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible AI agent directly to Runeforge to generate and deploy snippets without leaving their IDE.

### Scope
- **MCP server** — Go service implementing the Model Context Protocol; two transports:
  - HTTP/SSE hosted at `/mcp` (zero install — add URL to IDE config)
  - stdio via `npx @runeforge/mcp` (for IDEs that only support stdio)
- **10 MCP tools** exposed:

| Tool | Scope needed |
|------|-------------|
| `list_snippets` | invoke |
| `get_snippet` | invoke |
| `create_snippet` | manage |
| `update_draft` | manage |
| `publish_snippet` | manage |
| `invoke_snippet` | invoke |
| `get_logs` | invoke |
| `list_secrets` | manage |
| `set_secret` | manage |
| `get_metrics` | invoke |

### Developer setup (after this phase ships)
```json
// .cursor/mcp.json or ~/.claude/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "runeforge": {
      "url": "https://api.runeforge.io/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer rf_xxxx" }
    }
  }
}
```

### New services
- `services/mcp-server/` — Go service, thin wrapper over control plane API

---

## Phase 7 — Embeddable Dashboard

**Goal:** Let any org embed a white-label snippet browser directly into their own portal via a single `<iframe>` tag.

### Scope
- **Embed token API** — `POST /v1/embed/tokens` issues short-lived, read-only tokens scoped to a tenant (optionally to specific snippet IDs)
- **Embed app** — React SPA served from `embed.runeforge.io`:
  - Snippet list with search, language filter, env filter
  - Snippet detail: code viewer (Monaco, read-only), version sidebar, env status badges, recent invocations summary, p95 latency badge
  - Environment switcher (dev / staging / prod)
- **White-label theming** — theme via URL params (`?theme=dark&accent=6366f1`) or persisted branding config per tenant (`logo_url`, `accent_color`, `font_family`)
- **iframe security** — embed subdomain uses `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors *`; main app keeps `frame-ancestors 'none'`

### Integration (one line for orgs)
```html
<iframe src="https://embed.runeforge.io?token=et_xxxx" width="100%" height="700" frameborder="0" />
```

### New services
- `services/embed-dashboard/` — Vite + React, deployed to `embed.runeforge.io`

---

## Phase 8 — Hardening & Advanced Features

**Goal:** Production-grade security hardening, full schema-driven API docs, and enterprise auth.

### Scope
- **Firecracker executor plugin** — pluggable `Executor` interface implementation using AWS Firecracker microVMs; VM-boundary isolation; snapshot/restore for sub-50ms warm starts; requires KVM (bare metal or metal EC2 instances)
- **OpenAPI spec generation** — at publish time, extract Zod / Pydantic schemas and emit a full OpenAPI 3.1 spec for the snippet's invoke endpoint; expose at `GET /v1/snippets/{id}/openapi.json`
- **JWT auth** — RS256 JWTs as an alternative to API keys; short-lived (15min) + refresh tokens; intended for Web IDE sessions and user-facing callers
- **Seccomp profiles** — production-grade syscall allowlist for the ProcessExecutor; block `ptrace`, `mount`, `clone(CLONE_NEWUSER)`, `perf_event_open`, etc.
- **Audit log** — append-only log of all management actions (publish, secret create, egress change) per tenant; queryable by admin
